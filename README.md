  ## Description
  This project focuses on Progressive Web Application (PWA) to build an online budget tracker. With the use of this web page, a user can log their daily transactions whether they are online or offline. This functionality is made possible by the use of cached data, which stores static web page information that will rarely change in one collection, and offline pending budget transactions in local storage, which will push the changes to the database once an Internet connection is re-established.
